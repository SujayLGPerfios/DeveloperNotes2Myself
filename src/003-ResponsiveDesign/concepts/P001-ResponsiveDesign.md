# Description: Introduction to Responsive Design

### Meaning of Responsiveness
- Any platform
- Any browser size
- Any screen size
- Any resolution
- Any orientation

### Various Responsive Options
1. Responsive Web Design (RWD): Involves fluid measurements, flexible grids, and varying CSS rules.
2. Adaptive Design (Dynamic Serving): Returns one of multiple versions of a page based on the type of device.
3. Separate Mobile Site (.m): A separate page URL for the mobile site.

### Advantage of RWD Over Other Responsive Options
* Easier to share your data with a single URL.
* Easier for search engines like Google to index the page.
* Fewer files = less maintenance.
* Less redirection = lower load time.
