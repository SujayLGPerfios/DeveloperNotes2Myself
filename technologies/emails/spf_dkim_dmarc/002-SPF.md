# Description: Senders Policy Framework (SPF)

### Introduction to SPF
* SPF is an email validation protocol designed to detect and block email spoofing by providing a mechanism to allow 
  receiving mail exchangers to verify that incoming mail from a domain comes from an IP Address authorized by that 
  domain's administrators.
* The list of authorized sending hosts and IP addresses for a domain is published in the Domain Name System (DNS) 
  records for that domain in the form of a specially formatted TXT record.
* Email spam and phishing often use forged "from" addresses and domains, so publishing and checking SPF records can be 
  considered one of the most reliable and simple to use anti-spam techniques.
* SPF configurations ONLY involves DNS Servers changes. No changes are to be made on the mail server.

### Features of SPF
* [Good] Recognizes spoofed e-mails sent to us from other domains.
* [Good] Recognizes spoofed e-mails sent to others from own domain.
* [Good] It's easy to deploy as there is nothing to configure on mail server. Only DNS changes are required.
* [Bad] Does NOT prevent someone from sending emails from the own domain.
* [Bad] Depends on the transit servers.
* [Bad] Whenever message is forwarded, SPF breaks. This can be partially solved by SPF:SRS.

### SPF Record Syntax
* The SPF record is one of the domain name DNS zone records.
* It should be added as a TXT record in the DNS zone of the domain.
* A Sender Policy Framework record of a domain should look like below.
```
     record    | TTL  | type | data 	
-----------------------------------------------------
| domain1.com.   86400  TXT    "v=spf1 mx a -all"   |
-----------------------------------------------------
``` 
* **domain1.com.:** Update "domain1.com" to the actual domain name. Once can use the "@" symbol which means "the current 
  domain".
* **86400:** TTL parameter which indicates how long the local name server cache will keep the record in its memory.
* **TXT:** DNS zone record type. SPF records are written as TXT records.
* **v=spf1:** Identifies the type of the TXT record - utilizing SPF version 1.
* **mx:** Allow servers listed as MX to send email for this domain.
* **a:** Allow current IP address of the domain to send email for this domain.
* **- before a:** A symbol that determines how strict should the servers treating the emails be 
    * "-" - fail
    * "~" - softfail
    * "?" - neutral
* **all:** A default mechanism matching all IPs that are not matched by prior mechanisms.
* **ip4:1.2.3.4:** This should be added before "-all". It specifies the IP address that delivers or relays mail for your 
  domain. Update 1.2.3.4 should be changed with the real IP address.
* **a:domain2.com:** should be added before "-all". It defines any other server hostname that may deliver or relay mail 
  for the domain.
* **include:domain3.com:** This should be added before "-all". It specifies any domains that may deliver or relay mail 
  for your domain.

### SPF Record Examples
* SPF record to specify from my domain, only my mail exchangers (MX Record in my DNS points to it) can send out emails, 
  those are my email servers.
    ```
    Name    : example.com.
    Type    : TXT
    TTL     : 86400
    Value   : "v=spf1 mx a -all"
    ```
* SPF record to specify from my domain, only my MXs and mail A record of my domain can send out e-mails From my domain, only my MXs and mail A record of my domain (example.com) can send 
  out e-mails. 
    ```
    Name    : example.com.
    Type    : TXT
    TTL     : 86400
    Value   : "v=spf1 a mx -all"
    ```
* SPF record to specify from my domain, only my MXs and all the IP addresses with A record of mailers.example.com can 
  send out e-mails. 
    ```
    Name    : example.com.
    Type    : TXT
    TTL     : 86400
    Value   : "v=spf1 a:mailers.example.com mx -all"
    ```
* SPF record to specify from my domain, only CIDR network 62.77.84.0/24 can send out emails.
    ```
    Name    : example.com.
    Type    : TXT
    TTL     : 86400
    Value   : "v=spf1 ip4:62.77.84.0/24 mx -all"
    ```
* SPF record to specify from my domain, only my MX and all servers allowed by SPF record of the domain vendor.com 
    ```
    Name    : example.com.
    Type    : TXT
    TTL     : 86400
    Value   : "v=spf1 mx include:vendor.com -all"
    ```
* SPF record to specify from my domain, only my mail exchangers (MX records in my DNS points to it) can send out 
  emails, those are my mail servers. 
    ```
    Name    : example.com.
    Type    : TXT
    TTL     : 86400
    Value   : "v=spf1 mx ~all"
    ```
    - Tilde (~) means, that domain, or their SPF record is in the transition period which means the admin believes that 
      valid messages can be delivered from other than listed IPs.
    - It is up to the other (receiving) side, how it will   handle this so called soft-fail.
