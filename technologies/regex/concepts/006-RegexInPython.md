# Description: Regular Expression in Python

### Regex in Python

### Python Re Module
1. The re module provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python.
2. Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings as well as 8-bit strings.
3. Regular expression operations are available as module-level functions and RegexObject methods. 
4. Python has raw string notation for regular expression patterns where backslashes are not handled in any special way 
   in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r"\n" is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while "\n" is a 
   one-character string containing a newline.

### TODO
* None
