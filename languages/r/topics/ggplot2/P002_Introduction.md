# Description: WriteHere in R

### Note
* Install ggplot2 package
```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

* All plots are composed of the following
    1. Data: Raw or processed data to be visualised.
    2. Aesthetic Mappings: A set of aesthetic mappings describing how variables in the data are mapped to aesthetic 
       attributes that can be perceived.
    3. Layers: Layers made up of geometric elements (*geoms*) and statistical transformation (*stats*).
    4. Scale: The scales map values in the data space to values in an aesthetic space. It could be colour, size, space, 
       legends or axes.
    5. Coordinate System (*coord*):Coords describes how data coordinates are mapped to the plane of the graphic.
    6. Faceting: A faceting specification describes how to break up the data into subsets and how to display those 
       subsets as small multiples. This is also known as conditioning or latticing/trellising.
    7. Theme: A theme which controls the finer points of display, like the font size and background colour.

* Limitations of ggplot2
    1. The ggplot2 package can only create static graphics. Look at package like ggvis for dynamic and interactive
       graphics.
    2. The ggplot2 package is not ideal for visualising graphs. Look at igraph package instead.
    3. The ggplot2 cannot be used to create 3D graphs or mosaic plots.

* The ggplot2 comes with following sample datasets. 
    - diamonds Prices of 50,000 round cut diamonds
    - economics US economic time series.
    - midwest Midwest demographics.
    - movies Movie information and user ratings from IMDB.com.
    - mpg Fuel economy data from 1999 and 2008 for 38 popular models of car
    - msleep An updated and expanded version of the mammals sleep dataset.
    - presidential Terms of 10 presidents from Eisenhower to Bush W.
    - seals Vector field of seal movements.
