# Description: Introduction to Apache Camel

### Introduction
* Apache Camel is a versatile open-source integration framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns.
* Camel can be used to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of domain-specific languages, including a 
  Java-based Fluent API, Spring or Blueprint XML Configuration files, and a Scala DSL. In short, Camel can get smart 
  completion of routing rules in an IDE, whether in a Java, Scala or XML editor.
* Apache Camel uses URIs to work directly with any kind of Transport or messaging model such as HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, 
  JBI, SCA, MINA or CXF, as well as pluggable Components and Data Format options.
* Apache Camel is a small library with minimal dependencies for easy embedding in any Java application.
* Apache Camel uses the same API regardless of the kind of Transport used.
* Apache Camel provides support for Bean Binding and seamless integration with popular frameworks such as CDI, Spring, 
  Blueprint and Guice. 
* Camel also has extensive support for unit testing your routes.
