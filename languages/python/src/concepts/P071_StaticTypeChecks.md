# Description: Static Type Checking in Python

### Static Type Checking
* Static type checking is available from Python 3.6 onwards with some sane syntax.
* Static type checking is optional.
* Static Type for Functions
    - Use Union type to declare a function that can accept multiple types.
    - Use Any type to declare a function that can accept anything.
* Python 3.6 also supports some of the fancy typing stuff like generic types and custom user-defined types.
    - Read about it in [Python Type Support](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)

### Running the Type Checker
* While Python 3.6 gives a syntax for declaring types, thereâ€™s absolutely nothing in Python itself yet that does 
  anything with these type declarations. To actually enforce type checking, do one or both of of two things, namely,
    - Download the open-source mypy type checker and run it as part of your unit tests or development workflow.
    - Use PyCharm which has built-in type checking in the IDE.
