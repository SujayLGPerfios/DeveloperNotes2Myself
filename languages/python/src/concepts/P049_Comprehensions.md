# Description: Comprehensions in Python

### Comprehensions
* List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
* A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for
  or if clauses.

### Advantages of Comprehensions
* List Comprehensions reduces lines of code.
* In certain cases, list comprehension is better as Python allocates the list’s memory first, before adding the elements 
  to it, instead of having to resize on runtime.
* Code using comprehensions is considered more 'Pythonic' and better fitting Python’s style guidelines.
