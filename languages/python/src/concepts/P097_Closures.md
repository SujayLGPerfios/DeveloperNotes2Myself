# Description: Closures

### Terminologies
* Nested Functions
* Non-local Variables
* Closure

### When and Why to Use Closures
* As closures are used as callback functions, they provide some sort of data hiding. This helps us to reduce the use of 
  global variables.
* When there are a few functions in our code, closures prove to be efficient way. But if we need to have many functions, 
  then go for class (OOP).

### TODO
* None
