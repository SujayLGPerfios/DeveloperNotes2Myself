# Description: Filter Function in Python

  to be true or not.
* The general syntax is `filter(function, sequence)` where
    - function: It is a function that tests if each element of a sequence is true or not.
    - sequence: Any sequence which needs to be filtered. Sequence can be sets, lists, tuples, or containers of any 
                iterators.
    - **Returns**: The function returns an iterator that is already filtered.
