<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- 
	Description: An example to explain about XML declaration
	Note: 
		1. The element <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> is called XML Declaration.
		2. If xml element is present then it has to be the first element in the XML document. No even empty space or line is allowed before this element.
		3. This element has got 3 attributes as follows
			version		: Required Field and value must be 1.0
			encoding		: Optional field. Encoding value is not case sensitive so UTF-8, utf-8 and Utf-8 are all equivalent. 
			standalone	: Optional field. Value can be yes or no. Yes means no external DTD or XML Schema while yes means external DTD or XML Schema
		4. XML Declaration is optional if encoding is UTF-8 or UTF-16 otherwise xml declaration must be present in an XML Document
		5. Though this element is optional but it helps in certain optimizations.
		6. This is not a PI as it is uniquely defined as part of REC 1.0
		7. version encoding and standalone seems to be attribute but their order has to be strictly maintained ie version should be followed by encoding and encoding should be followed by standalone
