	Description: An example to explain how whitespaces are treated in XML
	Note: 
		1. Only following four characters are treated as whitespace
			x09	: Horizontal Tab(HT)
			x0A	: Line Feed(LF)
			x0D	: Carriage Return(CR)
			x20	: Space
		2. All white spaces except CR in contents are preserved by the parser and passed on to the application unmodified 
		3. All white spaces in element names and attributes MAY BE REMOVED by the parser
		4. Parser converts LF, CR or LF+CR into single LF character.
		5. New Line in various system
				In Windows applications, a new line is normally stored as a pair of characters: carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF). 
				In Unix applications, a new line is normally stored as a LF character. 
				In Macintosh applications only a CR character is used to store a new line.
