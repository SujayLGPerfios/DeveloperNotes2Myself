<!-- 
	Definition	: A simple element is an XML element that contains only text. It cannot contain any other elements or attributes.
	Syntax: 	  <xs:element name="xxx" type="yyy"/>
	Attributes:
		name	: xxx is the name of the element 
		type		: yyy is the data type of the element. XML Schema has a lot of built-in data types. The most common types are 
						xs:string 
						xs:decimal 
						xs:integer 
						xs:boolean 
						xs:date 
						xs:time 
	Notes: 
		1. The text can be of many different types. It can be one of the types included in the XML Schema definition (boolean, string, date, etc.), or it can be a custom type that you can define yourself
		2. You can also add restrictions (facets) to a data type in order to limit its content, or you can require the data to match a specific pattern.
